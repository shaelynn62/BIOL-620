library(affy)
eset <- ReadAffy()
# Perform RMA normalization
eset_Norm <- rma(eset)
rma<- exprs(eset_Norm)

#Log base 2, or base 10, To perform log transformation do following

Treatment<- apply(rma[,c("GSM4843.CEL.gz", "GSM4844.CEL.gz")],1,log)
Control<-apply(rma[,c("GSM4845.CEL.gz","GSM4846.CEL.gz", "GSM4847.CEL.gz")],1,log)

TRANSPOSE: Switch columns to rows and rows to columns!

# Perform transpose so that samples are your columns and genes are your rows!!

Treatment_T <- t(Treatment)

Control_T <- t(Control)

head(Treatment_T)

# To make fold changes, we first need to take mean/ average for treatment and control sample

Treatment_T_Mean <- rowMeans(Treatment_T)
Control_T_Mean <- rowMeans(Control_T)

# Get the subtraction fold change for treatment over control

Fold_Change <- Treatment_T_Mean-Control_T_Mean

# Assignment: Export variable "Fold_Change" as a ,csv format file with name "fold_changes.csv"
